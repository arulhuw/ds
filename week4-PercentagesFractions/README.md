# Percentages & Fractions
## Converting percents to decimals:
>To write a percent as a decimal, you can divide by 100 and remove the percent sign. So, 143% is equal to 143 / 100 = 1.43.
50% = 50 / 100 = 0.5
25% = 25 / 100 = 0.25
10% = 10 / 100 = 0.1

- Calculating percentage ‘rate’ 
    > **RATE = PORTION / BASE x 100**
- Calculating ‘portion’ or ‘part’
    > **PORTION = BASE x RATE** 
- Calculating ‘base’ or ‘total’ 
    > **BASE = PORTION / RATE**
    Remember the rate must be calculated using the decimal value
## Calculating the percentage ‘rate’  

> **RATE = PORTION / BASE x 100**

> Find the percentage rate 

1. If 20 cars were sold from a garage that had 50 cars, what percentage of cars were sold? 
   - **20 (portion) / 50 (base) x 100 = 40%**
2. Ali gave correct answers to 23 out of 25 questions on a driving test. What percentage of the questions did he get correct? 
   - **23 (portion) / 25 (base) x 100 = 92%**



## Calculating ‘portion’ 
   - portion is the percentage rate expressed in ‘raw’ value. 
> **PORTION = BASE x RATE** 
    > change the percentage into a decimal before multiplying. 
    > Find portion or part

1. 75% of students in a class of 40 passed the first test. How many students passed? 
   - **40 (base) x 0.75 (rate) = 30 students passed**
2. An ice cream truck began its daily route with 95 litres of ice cream. The truck driver sold 78% of the ice cream. How many litres of ice cream were sold? Round to the nearest litre. 
   - **95 (base) x 0.78 (rate) = 74 litres of ice cream were sold**

## Calculating ‘base’  
> **BASE = PORTION / RATE**
Remember the rate must be calculated using the decimal value

### Find base or total ?
- Poker tournament rules state that 10% of players who pay the entry fee will finish winning some money. If 877 players win money, how many paid the entry fee? 
    >**877 (portion) / 0.1 (rate) = 8,770 players paid the entrance fee**
1. 48% of 12 is ____
    > find the portion. 
    > percentage rate (48%)
    > base (12), 
    > 0.48 x 12 = 5.76
2. 32% of _____ is 28 
    > find the base or total. 
    > rate (32%) 
    > portion (28),
    > 28 / 0.32 = 87.5


## Further practice

3. Holly Hobbs purchased a magazine at Atlanta airport for \$2.99. The tax on the purchase was \$0.18. What was the tax rate at the airport? Round to the nearest percent. 
    > find the rate or percentage. 
    > base or total (\$2.99) 
    > portion (\$0.18)
    > 0.18 / 2.99 x 100 =  6%

- Purchase price = $2.99
- Tax amount = $0.18
- Tax rate = tax amount / purchase price = 0.18 / 2.99 = 0.0602 = 6.02%
- Round to the nearest percent = 6.0%



## Expressing ‘part of whole’ using fractions


### What are fractions? 
> ##### decimals and percentages are ways of describing part of a whole. 

### fractions. 

- There are two parts to every fraction. 
  1. numerator 
  2. denominator 


### Percentages to fractions

- place the non-zero digit(s) after the decimal point
- numerator (on top)
- power of 10 as the denominator 
- same number of zeros as decimal places. 

Percent | Fraction
------- | --------
10%     | 1/10
25%     | 1/4
50%     | 1/2
75%     | 3/4
100%    | 1

### Decimals to fractions 

- place the non-zero digit(s) after the decimal point
- numerator (on top) 
- power of 10 as the denominator
- same number of zeros as there were decimal places.
