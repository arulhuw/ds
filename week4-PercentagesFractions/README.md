# Percentages & Fractions
## Converting percents to decimals:
>To write a percent as a decimal, you can divide by 100 and remove the percent sign. So, 143% is equal to 143 / 100 = 1.43.
50% = 50 / 100 = 0.5
25% = 25 / 100 = 0.25
10% = 10 / 100 = 0.1


- Calculating percentage ‘rate’ 
- Calculating ‘portion’ or ‘part’
- Calculating ‘base’ or ‘total’ 


## Calculating the percentage ‘rate’  

> **RATE = PORTION / BASE x 100**

> Find the percentage rate 

1. If 20 cars were sold from a garage that had 50 cars, what percentage of cars were sold? 
   - **20 (portion) / 50 (base) x 100 = 40%**
2. Ali gave correct answers to 23 out of 25 questions on a driving test. What percentage of the questions did he get correct? 
   - **23 (portion) / 25 (base) x 100 = 92%**



## Calculating ‘portion’ 
   - portion is the percentage rate expressed in ‘raw’ value. 
> **PORTION = BASE x RATE** 
> find this we perform the following calculation
> change the percentage into a decimal before multiplying. 

> Find portion or part

1. 75% of students in a class of 40 passed the first test. How many students passed? 

   - 40 (base) x 0.75 (rate) = 30 students passed



2. An ice cream truck began its daily route with 95 litres of ice cream. The truck driver sold 78% of the ice cream. How many litres of ice cream were sold? Round to the nearest litre. 
   - 95 (base) x 0.78 (rate) = 74 litres of ice cream were sold
