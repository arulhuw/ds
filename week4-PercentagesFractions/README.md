# Percentages & Fractions
## Converting percents to decimals:
>To write a percent as a decimal, you can divide by 100 and remove the percent sign. So, 143% is equal to 143 / 100 = 1.43.
50% = 50 / 100 = 0.5
25% = 25 / 100 = 0.25
10% = 10 / 100 = 0.1


- Calculating percentage ‘rate’ 
    > **RATE = PORTION / BASE x 100**
- Calculating ‘portion’ or ‘part’
    > **PORTION = BASE x RATE** 
- Calculating ‘base’ or ‘total’ 
    > **BASE = PORTION / RATE**
    Remember the rate must be calculated using the decimal value


## Calculating the percentage ‘rate’  

> **RATE = PORTION / BASE x 100**

> Find the percentage rate

## Calculating ‘portion’

> **PORTION = BASE x RATE** 
    > change the percentage into a decimal before multiplying. 
    > Find portion or part

2. An ice cream truck began its daily route with 95 litres of ice cream. The truck driver sold 78% of the ice cream. How many litres of ice cream were sold? Round to the nearest litre. 
   - **95 (base) x 0.78 (rate) = 74 litres of ice cream were sold**

## Calculating ‘base’  
> **BASE = PORTION / RATE**
Remember the rate must be calculated using the decimal value

### Find base or total ?

2. 32% of _____ is 28 
    > find the base or total. 
    > rate (32%) 
    > portion (28),
    > 28 / 0.32 = 87.5




3. Holly Hobbs purchased a magazine at Atlanta airport for \$2.99. The tax on the purchase was \$0.18. What was the tax rate at the airport? Round to the nearest percent.
