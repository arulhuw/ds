# Week 2: Maths recap

## Key terms 

- Whole numbers: 
> a number from the set of numbers including zero: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4…….
 
- Integers  
> the set of numbers that includes the positives of whole numbers, the negatives of whole 				numbers, and zero. 

  > -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 

## Practice 

1. Which of the following are not whole numbers?

- 5
- -14
- ~~20.5~~
- 9,483
- 23,976
- 153,725
- 300,000,000
- ~~205,309,841.2~~
- 124,996,348,771



2. Big number bingo! 

- Step 1: Draw a 3x3 grid on a piece of paper or on your computer. 

- Step 2: Go to the document called ‘Bingo!’ on the week 2 tile and write or copy and paste nine of the numbers on to your grid.  


|a|b|c|
|-|-|-|
|660,566  |999,130|15,216|
|six hundred sixty thousand and five hundred sixty six  |nine hundred ninety nine thousand and one hundred thirty |fifteen thousand two hundred and sixteen|
|82,214|16,250|114,314|
|999,130|160,250|150,2164|


3. Rounding whole numbers


- Exact numbers are not always necessary or desirable. 
- For example, a board of directors does not want to know to the penny how much was spent on office supplies (although the accounting staff should know!). 
- Approximate or rounded numbers are often used instead. 
- A rounded number does not represent an exact amount. 
- It is instead an approximate number. 
- You round a number to a specified place, 
- which may be the first digit from the left of the number. 

### How to round whole numbers 

1. Locate the place to which the number is to be rounded. Draw a line under that place. 
2. If the first digit to the right of the underlined place is 5 or 			more, increase the digit in the place to which you are rounding by 1. If the first digit to the right of the underlined	place is 4 or less, do not change the digit in the place to which you are rounding.
3. Change all digits to the right of the underlined digit to zeros.

### Example
> ##### Round 579 to the nearest 10. 
- Step 1: 	579. 
- Step 2: 	‘9’ is above 5, so increase ‘7’ by 1. 
- Step 3: 	Change digits to the right of the underlined digit to zero.
- Answer: 	580 

### Front-end rounding 

- Front-end rounding is used to provide an estimate. 
- It involves rounding the first digit and changing the others to zeros.  
- The graphic below shows the top oil producing areas in the U.S. 
- We can apply front-end rounding to estimate total oil production from these areas. 




|State      |Actual       |Front-End Rounded|
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
|Texas	   	|1,263,630,000|   1,000,000,000 |
|Offshore	  |552,975,000	|     600,000,000 |
|N. Dakota	|429,605,000	|	    400,000,000 |
|California	|201,115,000	|	    200,000,000 |
|Alaska		  |176,295,000	|     200,000,000 !
|			      |2,623,620,000|   2,400,000,000 |

How would you say both totals?
